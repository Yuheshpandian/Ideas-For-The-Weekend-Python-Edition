# Python Quiz Game

## Overview
This Python Quiz Game project is designed to provide an interactive way for users to test their knowledge across various topics. The game presents a series of questions with multiple-choice answers, allowing players to select the correct option. It aims to be educational and entertaining, catering to users of all ages.

## Requirements
To run the Python Quiz Game project, you need the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- The `random` module (usually included with Python installations) !Optional 
- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for Python coding

## How to Build
Follow these steps to create the Python Quiz Game project:

1. Open your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
2. Create a new Python file and name it `quiz_game.py`.
3. Define the structure of the quiz game, including functions for generating questions, presenting them to the user, and evaluating their answers.

```python


def generate_question():
    # Generate a question and answer options
    question = "What is the capital of France?"
    options = ["A. Paris", "B. London", "C. Berlin", "D. Rome"]
    answer = "A"
    return question, options, answer

def present_question(question, options):
    # Present the question and options to the user
    print(question)
    for option in options:
        print(option)

def evaluate_answer(user_answer, correct_answer):
    # Evaluate the user's answer
    return user_answer == correct_answer
```

4. Now implement the main game and score calculation logic
```python
def main():
    score = 0
    for _ in range(5):  # 5 questions for example
        question, options, correct_answer = generate_question()
        present_question(question, options)
        user_answer = input("Your answer (A, B, C, or D): ").upper()
        if evaluate_answer(user_answer, correct_answer):
            print("Correct!")
            score += 1
        else:
            print("Incorrect!")
    print("Quiz completed! Your score:", score)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
5. Test each component of the game to ensure they work as expected.
6. Once satisfied with the functionality, you can optionally add more features such as a scoring system, a timer, or a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance the user experience.
